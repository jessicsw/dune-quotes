Not one answer, not one suffices.\n\nWhat prisms flash when I enter the terrible field of my past. I am a chip of shattered flint enclosed in a box. The box gyrates and quakes. I am tossed about in a storm of mysteries. And when the box opens, I return to this presence like a stranger in a primitive land.\n\nSlowly (slowly, I say) I relearn my name.\n\nBut that is not to know myself!\n\nThis person of my name, this Leto who is the second of that calling, finds other voices in his mind, other names and other places. Oh, I promise you (as I have been promised) that I answer to but a single name. If you say, "Leto," I respond. Sufferance makes this true, sufferance and one thing more:\n\nI hold the threads!\n\nAll of them are mine. Let me but imagine a topic say... men who have died by the sword-and I have them in all of their gore, every image intact, every moan, every grimace.\n\nJoys of motherhood, I think, and the birthing beds are mine. Serial baby smiles and the sweet cooings of new generations. The first walkings of the toddlers and the first victories of youths brought forth for me to share. They tumble one upon another until I can see little else but sameness and repetition.\n\n"Keep it all intact," I warn myself. Who can deny the value of such experiences, the worth of learning through which I view each new instant? Ahhh, but it\'s the past. Don\'t you understand? It\'s only the past!',

    text: "I try to tell them that all words are plastic. Word images begin to distort in the instant of utterance. Ideas imbedded in a language require that particular language for expression. This is the very essence of the meaning within the word exotic. See how it begins to distort?\n\nTranslation squirms in the presence of the exotic. The Galach which I speak here imposes itself. It is an outside frame of reference, a particular system. Dangers lurk in all systems. Systems incorporate the unexamined beliefs of their creators. Adopt a system, accept its beliefs, and you help strengthen the resistance to change.",

    text: "În tot universul meu, n-am întâlnit nicio lege a naturii imuabilă și inexorabilă. Acest univers nu prezintă decât relații schimbătoare care, uneori, sunt percepute drept legi de către conștiințele cu o existență vremelnică. Aceste ansambluri de simțuri carnale pe care le numim sine sunt efemeride ce pier în lumina orbitoare a infinitului, conștiente doar o clipită de anumite condiții provizorii, care ne limitează activitățile și se schimbă odată cu ele. Dacă trebuie să dați un nume absolutului, dați-i numele cuvenit: Provizoriu.",

It is that sense which tells you how to be true to yourself.” “Your religion is not enough,” she said. “No religion can ever be enough. It is a matter of choice—a single, lonely choice. Do you understand now why your friendship and your company mean so much to me?” She blinked back tears, nodding, then: “Why don’t people know this?",

Eventually, travel comes to mean freedom.” “But the spice dwindles,” she said. “And freedom becomes more precious every day.” “This can only lead to desperation and violence,” she said. “A wise man in my ancestry—I was actually that person, you know?

Огледай по-добре някоя консервативна личност и тя ще се окаже човек, който предпочита миналото пред бъдещето. Направи същото с либерал и ще откриеш готов аристократ. Вярно е! Либералните правителства винаги се превръщат в аристократични кръгове. Бюрократичните прослойки изменят на искрените стремежи на ония, които формират такава власт. Още от самото начало обикновените хора, създаващи правителствата и другите управленчески институции, обещали да урегулират тежестите за обществото, внезапно се оказват в ръцете на бюрократични аристократи. Разбира се, моделът на всички подобни машини е еднакъв, но какво двуличие е присъствието му дори под разветия флаг на установеното комунистическо управление. Да, така е; ако изобщо съм научил нещо от моделите и закономерностите, то е фактът на тяхното непрестанно повторение. Погледнато откровено, моето потисничество не е по-голямо зло от останалите варианти на гнет, но с негова помощ аз поне преподавам нов урок.",
